        <h3>The Problem : Because Teams Design Journeys They’ve Never Walked</h3>
    <p>There’s a quiet disconnect at the heart of modern product building.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>We talk endlessly about user journeys — we map them, annotate them, color-code them in FigJam and Figma. We build personas, empathy maps, and funnel dashboards. On paper, everything looks thoughtful.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>In practice, many of these journeys are imagined.</p>
</div>
<div>

<blockquote class="styled-text">
<p>Most product teams today spend more time interpreting users through tools — Jira tickets, analytics dashboards, customer summaries — than experiencing the reality of the people they’re building for. We say “user-first,” but we operate at arm’s length.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div>

<h3>The Illusion of Understanding Users</h3>
<p>
Today’s product teams rely heavily on:
</p>
</div>
<div>

<ul>
<li>Figma screens and prototypes</li>
<li>Personas and journey maps</li>
<li>Analytics dashboards</li>
<li>Support tickets and feedback summaries</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>

<p>
While these tools are valuable, they create a dangerous illusion: that we understand users without ever being one.
</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
Most PMs spend more time in:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Jira tickets</li>
<li>Sprint planning</li>
<li>Roadmap alignment meeting</li>
<li>Stakeholder presentations</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<p>Very little time is spent watching real users struggle, hesitate, recover from mistakes, or work around limitations. Over time, product decisions drift away from real behavior and move closer to internal assumptions.
</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Comfortable Lie We Tell Ourselves</h3>
<ul>
<li>“I know the user.”</li>
<li>“I’ve seen the metrics.”</li>
<li>“I’ve spoken to support.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>

<p>”All of these are useful. None of them are enough.</p>
<ul>
<li>Numbers tell you what happened.</li>
<li>Support tickets tell you where it hurts.</li>
<li>Neither tells you what it feels like to live inside the problem every day.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>

<p>That gap — between understanding and empathy — is where most products quietly fail.</p>
</div>
<div>

<h3>A Principle That Shaped How We Design</h3>
<p>Early on, we learned something that continues to guide how we approach every product we work on.</p>
<blockquote class="styled-text">
<p>The most valuable input doesn’t come from long requirement documents or polished briefs. It comes from time spent inside the user’s reality.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div>

<p>On one of our earliest engagements, instead of starting with wireframes or feature lists, we stepped away from the desk and into the actual day-to-day work of the people the product was meant for.</p>
<ul>
<li>Not as observers.</li>
<li>Not as interviewers.</li>
<li>But as participants.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>

<p>
We followed the same routines. Worked within the same constraints. Navigated the same approvals, delays, and system gaps. We experienced the same friction users had quietly adapted to over time.
</p>
<p>
And something became clear very quickly.</p>
</div>
<div>

<p>Once you’ve lived the problem, assumptions disappear.</p>
<ul>
<li>Design stops being about opinions or best practices.</li>
<li>Decisions become grounded, obvious, and defensible — because they’re anchored in real experience, not abstraction.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>

<p>
This principle has shaped our work ever since. Whenever possible, we don’t just map user journeys — we step into them. Because the most meaningful design insights don’t come from imagining the user’s world. They come from spending time inside it.

<h3>The Problem : Because Teams Design Journeys They’ve Never Walked</h3>
<p>The product that followed didn’t start with “features.”</p>
<p>It started with understanding:</p>
<ul>
<li>Where time was genuinely wasted</li>
<li>Which steps created anxiety or delay</li>
<li>Why offline options mattered</li>
<li>How people stitched broken systems together using spreadsheets, notes, and memory</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3>How Product Teams Can Practice Real Empathy</h3>
<p>A few habits that make a real difference:</p>
<p>It started with understanding:</p>
<ul>
<li>Regularly observe real usage, not just reports</li>
<li>Push beyond the first answer — ask why until patterns emerge</li>
<li>Pay attention to emotional friction, not just functional friction</li>
<li>Involve users early, even in rough, imperfect drafts</li>
<li>Bring real user stories into team discussions — not as anecdotes, but as design inputs</li>
</ul>
